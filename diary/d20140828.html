			<p>It's the first day that I prepare my lunch myself.</p>
			<p>Formerly, it's my GF's Mum who prepare my lunch, and yesterday, she went back home, it means that, in the future days, it should be myself who do the preparing.</p>
			<p>Woke up at 7:10 AM, almost the same time with S, she went to wash, and I began to cook. It's the first time cooking in the morning, so, the preparation is not enough, I spent about 10 minutes on searching cookbook, finally decided to cook the &lt;Chili and sour potato&gt;. Then washing and cutting vegetable costs almost 15 minutes. Cooking costs 5 minutes. Mentionable, in the cooking precedure, I put not enough oil, so some potato clinged to the bottom of the pan. It's not good, but fine. And another thing, the rice is not enough, either. I should put more rice the next time.</p>
			<p>Finish cooking at about 7:50 ＡＭ, wash face and rinse teeth in a hurry, wear clothes, and leave at about 8:10 AM. Got on the bus at about 8:40 AM(need to wait for the bus). And arrived company at about 9:30 AM.</p>
			<p>So, finally, if I prepare my lunch myself, before arriving company, it needs about 2.5 hours in the morning. Not too short, not too long~ I need to get used to this life rhythm. And I believe it will be improved in the future.</p>
